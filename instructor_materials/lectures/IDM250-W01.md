## Course Overview

^ In Web Authoring I you designed and coded static html pages. Everything that existed on the page, that you viewed in your browser window, was coded into the html file. With Content Management Systems like WordPress, the main sections of each page is broken into distinct parts (header, content, sidebar, footer), and the actual content is stored in a database. When you request a page in your browser the WordPress system dynamically assembles each page on the fly, grabbing the pieces and content that it needs, and generates the static html that is served to your browser. All of this information regarding style and layout is stored in your Theme folder. Since every page is dynamically driven it is important to have a comprehensive plan before you start coding or even designing.
