#Midterm
Convert your designs into a fully functional responsive static site. Place your static site inside a folder on your server called `static`. Your url should look like `https://yourdomain.com/idm250/static/`. The only feature on your site that should not work is the search functionality. All link should work, content is real, and images should be high quality.

## Github Release
Make sure your theme has been pushed to your repository. Once you've done that, you will need to create a release for this. 

### Creating a tag

1. Create a tag `git tag -l "v0.5.0"`
2. Annotate the tag `git tag -a v0.5.0 -m "v0.5.0"`
3. push the tag `git push origin v0.5.0`
