#Midterm
Convert your designs into a fully functional responsive static site. Place your static site inside a folder on your server called `static`. Your directory should look like `https://yourdoamin.com/idm250/static/`. The only feature on your site that should not work is the search feature. Everything link should work, content is real, and images should be high quality. 

## Github Release
Make sure your theme has been pushed to your repository. Once you've done that, you will need to create a release for this.
