## Project Overview
- Create a `readme.md` file at the root of your project. In this file, write a short description about your project and explain what it is (using [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)). This will help remind myself/others what your final project is. 


## How to Submit
Submit two links via Blackboard under one submission
- Upload your zipped file via your Wordpress website and send me a direct link to download it. Example: `http://idm250.local/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/idm250-001-pp455-hwk02.zip`
- Send me a link to your idm250 class repo so I can view your readme.md file
